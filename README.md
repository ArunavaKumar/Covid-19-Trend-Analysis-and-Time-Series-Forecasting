# Covid-19 Trend Analysis
## Covid-19 Time-series prediction and Dashboard for Trend Analysis
In this project, I developed an experimental approach to analyse the trend of the Covid-19 pandemic all over the India. For this experiment I mailny used some popular python packages like - **pandas**, **numpy** for computational purpose; **matplotlib**, **plotly**, **seaborn**, **dash** for visualization purpose. Finally I developed a interactive dashboard for displaying the final analysis for each state of India.
